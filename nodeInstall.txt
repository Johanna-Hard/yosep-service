AWS does not control the following code. Before you run it, be sure to verify its authenticity and integrity. More information about this code can be found in the nvm GitHub repository.

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash

Activate nvm by typing the following at the command line.

. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
Use nvm to install the latest version of Node.js by typing the following at the command line.

nvm install node

Test that Node.js is installed and running correctly by typing the following at the command line.

node -e "console.log('Running Node.js ' + process.version)"
This displays the following message that shows the version of Node.js that is running.
